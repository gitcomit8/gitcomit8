Malware Analysis For Dummies
============================

This guide walks you through malware analysis using three specialized virtual machines: **Slingshot**, **SIFT**, and **REMnux**. These VMs, combined with a shared encrypted drive for live malware samples, form a powerful and safe environment for analyzing malware.

* * * * *

**1\. Environment Setup**
-------------------------

### **1.1. VMs Overview**

-   **Slingshot**: A versatile VM with general-purpose tools for incident response and threat hunting.
-   **SIFT**: A forensic-focused VM designed for investigating disk images, memory dumps, and logs.
-   **REMnux**: A malware analysis powerhouse equipped with tools for static and dynamic analysis.

### **1.2. Shared Encrypted Drive**

-   A dedicated virtual disk shared between VMs to store live malware samples.
-   **Encrypt with LUKS** for security:

    ```
    sudo cryptsetup luksFormat /dev/sdX
    sudo cryptsetup open /dev/sdX malware-drive
    sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/mapper/malware-drive
    sudo mount /dev/mapper/malware-drive /mnt/malware

    ```

-   Mount only in one VM at a time and unmount after use.

### **1.3. Networking Setup**

-   **REMnux**:
    -   Use **NAT** for controlled internet access.
    -   Monitor network traffic with tools like Wireshark.
-   **SIFT & Slingshot**:
    -   Use **Host-Only Networking** or disconnect from the internet.

### **1.4. Safety Precautions**

-   **Snapshots**:
    -   Take snapshots of each VM before starting an analysis session.
-   **Isolation**:
    -   Disable shared folders, drag-and-drop, and clipboard sharing.
-   **Regular Backups**:
    -   Backup the encrypted malware drive periodically.

**2\. Accessing and Managing Malware Samples**
----------------------------------------------

### **2.1. Obtaining Samples from TheZoo**

-   Clone the repository:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/ytisf/theZoo.git
    cd theZoo

    ```

-   Extract malware samples (password: `infected`):

    ```
    7z x [sample].zip

    ```

-   Move extracted samples to the shared encrypted drive for safe storage.

### **2.2. Categorizing Malware**

-   Organize malware by type (e.g., ransomware, trojans) or family.
-   Maintain a document for metadata:
    -   File name
    -   Hash values (MD5, SHA256)
    -   Source (e.g., TheZoo)

**3\. Malware Analysis Workflow**
---------------------------------

### **3.1. REMnux: Dynamic Analysis**

Focus on observing the malware's behavior when executed.

#### Tools and Steps:

1.  **Behavior Observation**:
    -   Use Cuckoo Sandbox to run malware:

        ```
        cuckoo submit /path/to/malware

        ```

    -   Observe file modifications, registry changes, and process activity.
2.  **Network Traffic**:
    -   Monitor with Wireshark:

        ```
        wireshark

        ```

    -   Identify communication with command-and-control (C2) servers.
3.  **Static Analysis**:
    -   Extract strings:

        ```
        strings /path/to/malware

        ```

    -   Analyze binary structure with Radare2 or Ghidra.

### **3.2. SIFT: Forensic Analysis**

Examine artifacts left by malware, such as memory dumps or disk images.

#### Tools and Steps:

1.  **Memory Forensics**:
    -   Use Volatility to analyze memory dumps:

        ```
        volatility -f memory.dmp --profile=Win7SP1x64 pslist

        ```

2.  **File System Analysis**:
    -   Inspect disk images with Autopsy:

        ```
        autopsy

        ```

3.  **YARA Rules**:
    -   Detect similar malware samples:

        ```
        yara -r rule.yar /path/to/malware

        ```

### **3.3. Slingshot: Supplementary Tasks**

Use Slingshot for tasks requiring additional tools or as a backup environment.

**4\. Documentation and Reporting**
-----------------------------------

### **4.1. Keep a Log**

-   Document every step:
    -   Tools used
    -   Observations
    -   Indicators of Compromise (IOCs): IPs, domains, hashes.

### **4.2. Create Reports**

-   Summarize findings:
    -   Malware behavior
    -   Potential risks
    -   Recommended mitigations
-   Include screenshots of significant findings.

* * * * *

**5\. Advanced Tips**
---------------------

### **5.1. Automate Routine Tasks**

-   Use scripts to streamline processes like disk mounting or malware extraction.
-   Example: Mount shared drive on startup:

    ```
    sudo cryptsetup open /dev/sdX malware-drive
    sudo mount /dev/mapper/malware-drive /mnt/malware

    ```

### **5.2. Collaborate**

-   Share findings with peers (while maintaining data confidentiality).
-   Contribute YARA rules or analysis scripts to the community.

**6\. Final Thoughts**
----------------------

Malware analysis is both a science and an art. By using **Slingshot**, **SIFT**, and **REMnux** effectively, you can uncover the inner workings of malicious software while keeping your environment secure. Always prioritize safety and follow ethical guidelines. Happy analyzing!
